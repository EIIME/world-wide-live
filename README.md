# World Wide Live
>Connect live from anywhere on Earth!

Hosting URL: https://world-wide-live-9f9de.web.app/

This webapp helps users locate live video stream from Youtube based on location. The user can prompt a location, address or postal code and then is presented with active live video streams in a selected radius around that location. The stream is viewed in an embedded Youtube window. 

## What has been done so far
The user can search for a location and is presented with a list of live streams. The list includes titles and links to the youtube streams.

## What is left to do
- Styling, responsive layout, logo
- Embedded Youtube player (or link to Youtube if API cost is too high)
- Present more information about the stream
- Search features like radius and autocompletion

## Goals if there is time left
- Filter options like views, etc...
- An interactive map with markers for the live streams
- A random location option
